# Liquidity Management Bot for DeFi Tokens | Uniswap, PancakeSwap, DEX
Liquidity Management Bot is a powerful multi-chain solution for automatically balancing liquidity pools on platforms such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and other decentralized exchanges (DEXes). Liquidity Management Bot maintain token prices within a specified range (¬±1‚Äì10%), safeguards against MEV attacks (including sandwich attacks and frontrunning), and utilizes adaptive trading strategies (TWAP, VWAP, and threshold triggers) to optimize yields. 
The bot maintains price stability, minimizes volatility and protects against manipulation (MEV attacks, sandwich bots).

**Automated bot for token liquidity management on DEX.**
Maintains price stability, minimizes volatility and protects against manipulation.
Integrations: Uniswap v3/v4, PancakeSwap, Chainlink, Ethereum/BSC/Solana.

## üìå Features
**Automated Pool Balancing** 
- the bot performs auto-balancing of liquidity across pools on Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and other DEXes, ensuring stable and efficient trading.

**Price Control within a Specified Range** 
- A built-in price control mechanism maintains the token‚Äôs value within a predefined range (¬±1% to ¬±10%), minimizing volatility.

**Protection Against MEV Attacks** (sandwich bots, frontrunning).
- Advanced algorithms protect your funds against MEV attacks such as sandwich attacks and frontrunning, reducing the risk of market manipulation.

**Adaptive Strategies**: TWAP, VWAP, threshold triggers.
- Implementing strategies like TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price), VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price), and threshold triggers, the bot dynamically adjusts to changing market conditions.

**Multi-Chain Support**:
- The solution supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Solana, and Layer 2 solutions, offering flexibility and scalability for users worldwide.

**Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard:** for real-time monitoring.
- An integrated dashboard provides real-time monitoring of pool status, liquidity metrics, and trading activity, simplifying decision-making.

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js (to work with web3.js)
- Blockchain node (Infura/Alchemy for Ethereum, QuickNode for Solana) or public RPC.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameter setting

'general:

    token: "YOURTOKEN"

    base_currency: "USDT"

    blockchain: "ethereum"

    dex: "uniswap_v3"

liquidity:

    min_liquidity: 10000  # USD

    max_liquidity: 500000 # USD

    rebalance_threshold: 5%  # Unbalance for rebalancing

price_control:

    target_range: [0.97, 1.03]

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

Recommendations
1. Never use the private key of the main wallet.
Use a hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor) or multisig (Gnosis Safe).

2. Transaction limits:
Set the daily limit in config.yaml.

3. Backup:
Save configuration files and cid-phrases on a regular basis.

4. Auditing
Code and smart contracts should be audited by independent auditors before use in mainnet.
